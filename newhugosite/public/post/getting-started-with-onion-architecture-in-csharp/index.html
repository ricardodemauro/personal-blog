    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Software architecture is the cornerstone of a robust and maintainable application. In this article, we will explore <em>Onion Architecture with C#</em>, a design pattern that promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and testability.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take a deep dive into the layers of Onion Architecture while building a &ldquo;TODO List&rdquo; application to illustrate its principles.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-onion-architecture">What is Onion Architecture?</h2>
<p>Onion Architecture is a software architectural pattern that emphasizes the independence of an application&rsquo;s core business logic from external concerns. The core is surrounded by concentric layers, each with a distinct purpose, resembling the layers of an onion. This pattern was developed by Jeffrey Palermo and is inspired by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).</p>
<h3 id="other-architectural-patterns">Other Architectural Patterns</h3>
<p>Before delving into Onion Architecture, it&rsquo;s essential to understand other common architectural patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic</strong>: A monolithic architecture bundles all components into a single codebase. While simple, it can become unwieldy for large applications.</li>
<li><strong>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</strong>: MVC separates an application into three parts: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (user interactions). While effective for web applications, it lacks the modularity of Onion Architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Microservices divide an application into independently deployable services. It&rsquo;s ideal for large, complex systems but introduces operational complexities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="layers-of-onion-architecture">Layers of Onion Architecture</h2>
<p>Onion Architecture consists of multiple layers, each with specific responsibilities:</p>
<h3 id="1-coreapplication-layer">1. Core/Application Layer</h3>
<p>The core layer is the heart of the application and contains the business logic. In the &ldquo;Todo List&rdquo; application, it includes definitions for todo items and services to manage them.</p>
<p><strong>Example in C#</strong>:</p>
<p>csharpCopy code<code>public class TodoItem{ public int Id { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; } public bool IsDone { get; set; } } public interface ITodoService{ List&lt;TodoItem&gt; GetAll(); TodoItem GetById(int id); void Add(TodoItem item); void Update(TodoItem item); void Remove(int id); }</code></p>
<h3 id="2-infrastructure-layer">2. Infrastructure Layer</h3>
<p>The infrastructure layer surrounds the core and deals with technical concerns. It includes components like data access, external services, and framework-specific code. It should be designed to be replaceable.</p>
<p><strong>Example in C#</strong>:</p>
<p>csharpCopy code<code>public class TodoRepository{ // Implement data access methods here}</code></p>
<h3 id="3-persistence-layer">3. Persistence Layer</h3>
<p>Within the infrastructure layer, the persistence layer is responsible for data storage and access. It includes database models, repositories, and data access code. This layer interacts with the database, and its implementation can change without affecting the core.</p>
<p><strong>Example in C#</strong>:</p>
<p>csharpCopy code<code>public class TodoDbContext{ // Define your database context and models}</code></p>
<h3 id="4-presentationinterface-layer">4. Presentation/Interface Layer</h3>
<p>The outermost layer is the presentation or interface layer, which handles user interactions and the user interface. In our &ldquo;Todo List&rdquo; application, this layer includes the controller responsible for user actions.</p>
<p><strong>Example in C#</strong>:</p>
<p>csharpCopy code<code>public class TodoController{ private ITodoService _todoService; public TodoController(ITodoService todoService)    { _todoService = todoService; } // Implement controller actions for user interactions}</code></p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-onion-architecture">Benefits of Onion Architecture</h2>
<p>Onion Architecture offers numerous benefits for software development:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Modularity</strong>: The separation of concerns into layers makes the application highly modular. Developers can work on individual components without impacting the entire application.</li>
<li><strong>Testability</strong>: The core of the application is technology-agnostic, making it easy to write unit tests for business logic without involving external dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: With the infrastructure layer designed for replaceability, you can switch out components or technologies without affecting the core functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: As the application grows, Onion Architecture&rsquo;s clear separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and extend.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The modularity and flexibility of Onion Architecture make it well-suited for building scalable applications, whether they are small projects or large enterprise systems.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="building-the-todo-list-application">Building the &ldquo;Todo List&rdquo; Application</h2>
<p>To apply the principles of Onion Architecture, we have developed a &ldquo;Todo List&rdquo; application with clear separation of layers, enabling modularity and maintainability. This application can serve as a starting point for your own projects.</p>
<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ve explored Onion Architecture, its layers, and the benefits it offers in the context of building a &ldquo;Todo List&rdquo; application. By implementing this architectural pattern, you can create software that is easier to maintain, test, and scale.</p>
<hr>
<p>This article provides an in-depth understanding of Onion Architecture by using a &ldquo;Todo List&rdquo; application as an example. It covers the layers and benefits of this architectural pattern and demonstrates how it can be applied in real-world projects. Implementing Onion Architecture can greatly enhance the quality and maintainability of your C# applications.</p>
