<p>These codes serve as communication tools between web clients (usually browsers and mobile applications) and servers about the outcome of the HTTP request.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs discuss HTTP status codes in a developer‚Äôs context Ô∏èüî®.</p>
<h4 id="when-to-use-them">When to Use Them</h4>
<ul>
<li>Whenever a client makes a request (e.g. fetching a webpage or submitting a form), the server responds with an appropriate status code</li>
<li>Use them to indicate whether the request succeeded, encountered an error, or needs further action</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-they-matter">Why They Matter</h4>
<ul>
<li>Status codes help us troubleshoot issues. When something goes wrong (e.g. a broken link or server error), these codes provide clues</li>
<li>They guide our decision-making. For instance, a 404 (Not Found) tells us a resource isn‚Äôt available, so we can handle it gracefully</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-use-them">How to Use Them</h4>
<ul>
<li>As developers, we encounter status codes when building APIs, handling requests, or designing error pages.</li>
<li>Understanding their meanings helps us create robust, user-friendly applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#status-ranges">Status Ranges</a></li>
<li><a href="#most-used-status-codes">Most used Status Codes</a></li>
<li><a href="#common-status-codes">Common Status Codes</a></li>
<li><a href="#all-http-status-code-list">All HTTP Status Code List</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="status-ranges">Status Ranges</h2>
<p>Status codes are grouped into five ranges, each with a specific meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1xx (Informational)</strong>: These codes indicate that the request has been received and the server is continuing to process it.</li>
<li><strong>2xx (Successful)</strong>: These codes signify that the request was successful or that the server accepted it.</li>
<li><strong>3xx (Redirection)</strong>: These codes indicate that the client must take additional actions to complete the request (e.g., follow a redirection).</li>
<li><strong>4xx (Client Errors)</strong>: These codes indicate that the client (browser) made an error or requested a resource that doesn‚Äôt exist.</li>
<li><strong>5xx (Server Errors)</strong>: These codes indicate that the server encountered an issue while processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these ranges helps diagnose issues during web development.</p>
<h2 id="most-used-status-codes">Most used Status Codes</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs explore some frequently encountered status codes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>200 OK:</strong> The server successfully processed the request and returned the requested resource</li>
<li><strong>404 Not Found</strong>: The requested resource does not exist on the server</li>
<li><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: An unexpected condition occurred on the server</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-status-codes">Common Status Codes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>201 Created</strong>: This status code indicates that the server has successfully created a new resource as a result of the client‚Äôs request</li>
<li><strong>302 Found (or 301 Moved Permanently)</strong>: Used for redirection (temporary or permanent)</li>
<li><strong>400 Bad Request</strong>: When the client sends a malformed or invalid request (e.g., missing required parameters or incorrect data format), the server responds with a 400 status code</li>
<li><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong>: As mentioned earlier, this code indicates that the client lacks proper authentication to access a resource</li>
<li><strong>403 Forbidden</strong>: Unlike 401, which implies authentication failure, a 403 status code means that the client is authenticated but doesn‚Äôt have permission to access the requested resource</li>
<li><strong>429 Too Many Requests</strong>: When a client exceeds the rate limit (e.g., making too many requests in a short time), the server responds with a 429 status code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="all-http-status-code-list">All HTTP Status Code List</h2>
<h3 id="informational-responses-100199">Informational Responses (100‚Äì199)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>100 Continue</strong>: The client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished</li>
<li><strong>101 Switching Protocols</strong>: Sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client, indicating the protocol the server is switching to</li>
<li><strong>102 Processing (WebDAV)</strong>: Indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet</li>
<li><strong>103 Early Hints</strong>: Primarily used with the Link header, allowing preloading resources while the server prepares a response or pre-connects to an origin</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="successful-responses-200299">Successful Responses (200‚Äì299)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>200 OK</strong>: The request succeeded. The meaning of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù depends on the HTTP method:W**- GET**: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body**- HEAD**: Representation headers are included in the response without a message body**- PUT or POST**: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body**- TRACE**: The message body contains the request message as received by the server</li>
<li><strong>201 Created</strong>: A new resource was successfully created as a result of the request (typically after POST or some PUT requests)</li>
<li><strong>202 Accepted</strong>: The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It‚Äôs noncommittal, often used for batch processing or when another process handles the request</li>
<li><strong>203 Non-Authoritative Information</strong>: Returned metadata differs from the origin server but is collected from a local or third-party copy</li>
<li><strong>204 No Content</strong>: No content to send, but headers may be useful for caching</li>
<li><strong>205 Reset Content</strong>: Instructs the user agent to reset the document that sent the request</li>
<li><strong>206 Partial Content</strong>: Used when the Range header requests only part of a resource</li>
<li><strong>207 Multi-Status (WebDAV)</strong>: Conveys information about multiple resources</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="redirection-messages-300399">Redirection Messages (300‚Äì399)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>300 Multiple Choices</strong>: Indicates multiple options for the requested resource</li>
<li><strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong>: The requested resource has moved permanently to a new location</li>
<li><strong>302 Found (or 303 See Other)</strong>: Temporary redirection</li>
<li><strong>304 Not Modified</strong>: The client‚Äôs cached version of the resource is still valid</li>
<li><strong>307 Temporary Redirect (or 308 Permanent Redirect)</strong>: Similar to 302 but preserves the original request method</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="client-error-responses-400499">Client Error Responses (400‚Äì499)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>400 Bad Request</strong>: The client sent a malformed or invalid request</li>
<li><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong>: Authentication is required, and the client lacks proper credentials</li>
<li><strong>403 Forbidden</strong>: Authenticated client lacks permission to access the resource</li>
<li><strong>404 Not Found</strong>: The requested resource does not exist</li>
<li><strong>429 Too Many Requests</strong>: Client exceeded the rate limit</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="server-error-responses-500599">Server Error Responses (500‚Äì599)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: An unexpected condition occurred on the server</li>
<li><strong>502 Bad Gateway</strong>: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server</li>
<li><strong>503 Service Unavailable</strong>: The server cannot handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance</li>
<li><strong>504 Gateway Timeout</strong>: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server</li>
<li><strong>599 Network Connect Timeout Error</strong>: The network connection has timed out</li>
</ol>
