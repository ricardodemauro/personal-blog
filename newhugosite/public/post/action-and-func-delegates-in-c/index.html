    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In this article, we will explore two types of predefined delegates in C# <code>System.Action</code> and <code>System.Func</code>.</p>
<p>Delegates are one of the most important features of the C# language. We typically use them as a type-safe way to represent a method, which can be passed as an argument to another method.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics-of-delegates">The Basics of Delegates</h2>
<p>Before diving into Actions and Funcs let&rsquo;s discuss what Delegates are.</p>
<p>Delegates are a typed way to represent a method that can be passed as an argument to another method. We can use them as first-class objects, which means they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other methods, and returned as values from methods.</p>
<p>We see most of the use cases for delegates as event handling.</p>
<p>Check out this example of how a <em>Delegate</em> works:</p>
<ul>
<li>One button is pressed in the GUI</li>
<li>An Event is raised</li>
<li>A method (the event handlers) is executed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-the-action-delegate">Using the Action Delegate</h2>
<p>The <code>System.Action</code> delegate is a predefined delegate type in C# that represents a method that has a <strong>void</strong> return type and takes zero or more parameters.</p>
<p>We should use Actions in situations that perform computation without a return value.</p>
<p>C# has a few predefined Action delegates:</p>
<p>public delegate void Action(); //ðŸ‘‡ The function arguments are defined using Generics, avoiding boxing unboxing public delegate void Action<in T>(T obj); public delegate void Action&lt;in T1, in T2&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2); public delegate void Action&lt;in T1, in T2, in T3&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2, T3 arg3);</p>
<p>It continues overloading until 16 arguments.</p>
<p>Check out the syntax for using Action delegates:</p>
<p>Action helloWorldDelegate = () =&gt; Console.WriteLine(&ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;); helloWorldDelegate(); // Output: &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; //ðŸ‘‡ First and second arguments are integers Action&lt;int, int&gt; WriteSumOfDelegate = (operator1, operator2) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(&ldquo;Sum of {0} and {1} is {3}&rdquo;, operator1, operator2, operator1 + operator2); }; WriteSumOfDelegate(10, 20); //Output: &ldquo;Sum of 10 and 20 is 30&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="actions-with-non-void-return-here-is-the-func-delegate">Actions with Non-Void Return: Here is the Func Delegate</h2>
<p>The <code>System.Func</code> delegate is another predefined delegate type in C# that represents a method that has a return type and takes zero or more parameters.</p>
<p>We should use Funcs in situations that perform computation and return a value.</p>
<p>C# have some predefined Func<T> delegates:</p>
<p>public delegate TResult Func<out TResult>(); public delegate TResult Func&lt;in T, out TResult&gt;(T arg); public delegate TResult Func&lt;in T1, in T2, out TResult&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2);</p>
<p>It also continues overloading until 16 arguments.</p>
<p>Next is the syntax for using a Func delegate:</p>
<p>Func&lt;int, int&gt; DoubleItDelegate = (operator1) =&gt; { return operator1 * 2; }; var result = DoubleItDelegate(2); //returns 4 Console.WriteLine(&ldquo;Func Double result {0}&rdquo;, result); //âŒ¨ Output: &ldquo;Func Double result 4&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this example, we have defined a <code>Func</code> delegate that takes a <code>int</code> parameter and returns a <code>int</code> value. Then assign a lambda expression to the delegate, which <strong>doubles</strong> its input.</p>
<p>Finally, we call the delegate with an argument of 2, which returns the value 4.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we can see how powerful delegates are and allow us to treat methods as first-class objects.</p>
<p>The <code>Action</code> and <code>Func</code> delegates are two predefined types that are commonly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and other tasks that require passing a method as an argument to another method.</p>
