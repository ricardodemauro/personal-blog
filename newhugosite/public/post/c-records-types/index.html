<p>C# 9.0 introduces record types. You use the record keyword to define a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-records">What are records?</h3>
<p>A record type in C# 9 is a lightweight, immutable data type (or a lightweight class) that has read-only properties only. Because a record type is immutable, it is thread-safe and cannot mutate or change after it has been created.</p>
<h3 id="mutable-property">Mutable property</h3>
<p>A record type can have mutable properties if you use init-only setters.</p>
<h3 id="init-only-setters">Init-only setters</h3>
<p>You can initialize a record type only inside a constructor.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h3>
<p>You can create record types with immutable properties by using positional parameters or standard property syntax.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Record types are distinct from classes in that record types use value-based equality. Two variables of a record type are equal if the record type definitions are identical, and if for every field, the values in both records are equal.</p>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
