When developing console applications in C#, it's important to communicate the success or failure of your program back to the operating system. 

This is achieved through exit codes, which are integers returned by the program when it finishes execution. 

An exit code of `0` typically signifies success, while any non-zero value indicates an error.

## Setting Exit Codes in C#

In C#, you can set the exit code using the `Environment.ExitCode` property or the `Environment.Exit` method. Here's how you can use both:

### Using `Environment.ExitCode`

The `Environment.ExitCode` property allows you to set the exit code at the end of your `Main` method or anywhere in your application logic. Here's a simple example:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            // Your code logic here
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            
            // If everything went well
            Environment.ExitCode = 0;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
            
            // If an error occurred
            Environment.ExitCode = 1;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if the code runs successfully, the exit code is set to `0`. If an exception is caught, the exit code is set to `1`.

### Using `Environment.Exit`

The `Environment.Exit` method immediately terminates the process and sets the exit code. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            // Your code logic here
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            
            // If everything went well
            Environment.Exit(0);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
            
            // If an error occurred
            Environment.Exit(1);
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, `Environment.Exit(0)` is called if the code executes successfully, and `Environment.Exit(1)` is called if an exception occurs.

## Best Practices

1. **Standardize Exit Codes**: Decide on a standard set of exit codes for your application, where `0` represents success, and specific non-zero values represent different types of errors.
2. **Consistent Usage**: Ensure that exit codes are set consistently throughout your application, especially when handling exceptions.
3. **Documentation**: Document the exit codes used by your application, so users or other developers know what each code signifies.

By properly using exit codes, you can make your C# console applications more robust and easier to integrate into larger systems and automated processes.
