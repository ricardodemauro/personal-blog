HTTP status code 400, known as "Bad Request," indicates that the server cannot process the client's request due to client-side errors. These errors can include malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing.

A common scenario for a 400 status code is when the client sends a request with incorrect parameters, such as an invalid query string or body data that doesn't conform to the expected format. This response helps in debugging issues during API development, signaling the need to correct the request before resubmission.

In summary, a 400 status code highlights issues with the client's request, ensuring proper request formatting and validity.
