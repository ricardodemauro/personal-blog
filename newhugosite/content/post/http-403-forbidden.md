HTTP status code 403, or "Forbidden," indicates that the server understands the client's request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike a 401 status code, which signifies missing or invalid authentication, a 403 status means that the client's credentials are recognized but they do not have permission to access the requested resource.

This status is often encountered when a user tries to access a restricted area of a website or an API endpoint for which they lack the necessary privileges. For example, a regular user might receive a 403 response when attempting to access an admin panel.

In essence, a 403 status code enforces access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.
