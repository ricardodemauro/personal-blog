Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS, is a security mechanism that controls resource access from different domains.

By default, web browsers prevent web pages from requesting a domain other than the one that served the page.

This is called the same-origin policy. CORS provides a way for web applications to access resources from a different domain than the one from which the web application was served.

This article will discuss adding CORS support to a .NET 6 API.

## How to add CORS to .NET 6 Web API:

To add CORS support to a .NET 3.1 Web API, we need to use the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package. The following steps will guide you through the process:

Step 1: Install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package To install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package, use the following command in the Package Manager Console:



Step 2: Configure CORS in Startup.cs Open the Startup.cs file and add the following code in the ConfigureServices method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCors(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("CorsPolicy", builder =>
        {
            builder.AllowAnyOrigin()
                   .AllowAnyMethod()
                   .AllowAnyHeader();
        });
    });
}
```

This code configures the CORS policy. In this case, the policy allows any origin, any method, and any header. You can modify this policy to fit your needs.

Step 3: Enable CORS in the Application Pipeline, add the following code to the Configure method in the Startup.cs file:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseCors("CorsPolicy");

    // other middleware
}
```

This code enables the CORS middleware in the application pipeline. The name of the policy ("CorsPolicy") must match the name used in the ConfigureServices method.

## Conclusion

CORS is an important security mechanism that allows web applications to access resources from a different domain than the one they were served from. This article discussed using Microsoft to add CORS support to a .NET 3.1 Web API.AspNetCore.Cors package. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily enable CORS support in your .NET 3.1 Web API.
